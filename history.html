Campus Fellowship in the city of Port Harcourt, Rives State.<p class=lead>It all began with a relentless passion & hunger that makes fellowship with the Spirit a daily necessity.<p class=lead>Precisely on the 18th of December 2023 at 4:24am while I was praying I saw a vision of multitudes seated in an organised setting & I heard “FEED THEM”.<p class=lead>The environment appears to be like a university campus having a wide podium in a descending fashion, plenty of desk & lots of students.<p class=lead>The next day being 19th of December 2023 at about 2:28am while praying I heard “UNIPORT i.e University of Port Harcourt”.<p class=lead>By 3:02am I saw a crowd standing on their feet & I was right before them with their hands lifted high when I heard “IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME & THE CROWD ECHOED AMEN”<p class=lead>For two consecutive nights I had these visions & words with the same location so I knew God was sending me to the university campus to influence the lives of students for his kingdom.<p class=lead>This is the birth of the campus ministry known as Light Up Uniport Campus Fellowship (LUCF).<p class=lead>Thereafter, I asked the Lord what message is to be delivered to the students & His response was “YOU HAVE A STORY”.<p class=lead>The Lord's response brought me to an understanding that the gospel is the foundational knowledge that I must deliver to the students but my story is the strategy to woo students to come & experience how his word can change lives.<p class=lead>I asked for a name for the student ministry entrusted to me that people could identify with & he led me to the book of Genesis 1:1-3, John 1:1-5&9, Psalm 36:9, Hab 2:14.<p class=lead>The common word in all these Bible passages was Light, hence the name LIGHT UP UNIPORT CAMPUS FELLOWSHIP.<p class=lead>However, we began the fellowship on the 21st of March 2023 as a prayer forum between the hours of 5pm to 6pm every Thursday at the University Basketball court until the 8th of August 2024.<p class=lead>On the 17th of October 2024, we held our first official gathering as a fellowship that is duly registered.<p class=lead>Venue was assigned to us within the Abuja Campus where gatherings are held every Thursday by 5pm for an unforgettable experience in God's presence that features:<ul class=section-list><li class=lead>Deep Worship<li class=lead>High Praise<li class=lead>Transforming Word<li class=lead>Healings & Special Miracles</ul><p class=lead>Emmanuel Orupabo is the lead coordinator of this campus ministry, he is married to Ibiso Harry Emmanuel & they are blessed with two adorable girls, Emmanuella & Daniella.</section><section class="text-center contact light-bg"id=contact><h2 class="m-0 p-0 display-4 section-header transition">Contact
