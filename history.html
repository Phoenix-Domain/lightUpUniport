  A consistent prayer, study & fellowship routine is what birthed Light Up Uniport Campus 
  Fellowship in the city of Port Harcourt, Rives State.
    </p> 
    <p class="lead">
      It all began with a relentless passion & hunger that makes fellowship with the Spirit a 
      daily necessity.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Precisely on the 18th of December 2023 at 4:24am while I was praying I saw a vision of 
      multitudes seated in an organised setting & I heard “FEED THEM”. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      The environment appears to be like a university campus having a wide podium in a 
      descending fashion, plenty of desk & lots of students. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      The next day being 19th of December 2023 at about 2:28am while praying I heard 
      “UNIPORT i.e University of Port Harcourt”. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      By 3:02am I saw a crowd standing on their feet & I was right before them with their hands 
      lifted high when I heard “IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME & THE CROWD ECHOED AMEN”
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      For two consecutive nights I had these visions & words with the same location so I knew 
      God was sending me to the university campus to influence the lives of students for his 
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      This is the birth of the campus ministry known as Light Up Uniport Campus Fellowship 
      (LUCF). 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Thereafter, I asked the Lord what message is to be delivered to the students & His 
      response was “YOU HAVE A STORY”.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      The Lord's response brought me to an understanding that the gospel is the foundational 
      knowledge that I must deliver to the students but my story is the strategy to woo 
      students to come & experience how his word can change lives.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      I asked for a name for the student ministry entrusted to me that people could identify 
      with & he led me to the book of Genesis 1:1-3, John 1:1-5&9, Psalm 36:9, Hab 2:14. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      The common word in all these Bible passages was Light, hence the name LIGHT UP 
      UNIPORT CAMPUS FELLOWSHIP. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      However, we began the fellowship on the 21st of March 2023 as a prayer forum between 
      the hours of 5pm to 6pm every Thursday at the University Basketball court until the 8th 
      of August 2024. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      On the 17th of October 2024, we held our first official gathering as a fellowship that is 
      duly registered.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      Venue was assigned to us within the Abuja Campus where gatherings are held every 
      Thursday by 5pm for an unforgettable experience in God's presence that features:

      Harry Emmanuel & they are blessed with two adorable girls, Emmanuella & Daniella.
